This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router DOM v6 where nested routes fail to render correctly when a parent route uses a wildcard path.  The wildcard route inappropriately intercepts all requests, preventing the rendering of more specific child routes.  The solution involves restructuring the routing strategy to avoid the conflict between the wildcard route and nested routes.
